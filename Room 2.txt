North Region - Room 2:

-In this dark room to the north, the ground is covered in dirt and the walls are made of ancient stone. 

In one corner, a rusted chest sits, seemingly abandoned. However, on the floor, there's an almost imperceptible mechanism, as if waiting for something to trigger. 

Approaching the chest requires courage, as this room is determined to keep its secrets hidden.
