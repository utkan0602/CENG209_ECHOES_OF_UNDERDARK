West Transition - Room 11:

-In this room in the west, in the dim light, Elyra, the Lost Healer is kneeling, waiting in pain. 

Her face is pale, and her eyes are tired, with scars covering her body. 

The old charm in her hand seems to offer her some strength, but without her lost staff, she is powerless to heal. 

She is in desperate need of help and trusts you to find her missing staff for a side quest.
