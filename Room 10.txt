West Transition - Room 10:

-This room in the west holds a quiet, serene atmosphere, as if lost in silence. 

The floor is covered with old, earth-toned rugs, but in one corner, a staff is carefully placed.

Its length and shape suggest it holds an unusual power. However, it's unclear what you need to do with it. 

The staff is definitely here for a reason, but without understanding its purpose, taking it feels meaningless. 

You must be sure you need to take it.
