West Region - Room 12:

-This room in the west is surrounded by a somber atmosphere. 

The high ceiling seems to be adorned with lost stars, fading into the darkness. 

In the center of the room stands a massive and terrifying figure: Thal'gorath, the Earthbound Wraith. 

Its body is engulfed in dark energy rising from the depths of the earth, and the whispers of the dead echo around it. 

Each step it takes shakes the ground, and every gaze it casts carries a deadly threat. 

Even though you believe you have the strength to defeat it, your heart races with fear, and you hesitate to make a move. 

If you can overcome this terror and defeat the horrifying creature, a path to salvation will open.
