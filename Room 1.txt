North Transition - Room 1:

- In this dark room to the north, stone walls are covered with moss, and the floor is slippery.
In one corner, the eerie Cave Crawler silently patrols. 
In another corner, an old, rusty chest is placed carefully, seemingly offering a reward. 
However, the creature's presence makes getting to the chest difficult. Think carefully before entering the room.
