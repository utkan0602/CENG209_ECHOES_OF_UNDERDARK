East Transition - Room 6:

-This room in the east is filled with warm air, and the walls are covered in a thin mist.

A faint fog rises from the ground, limiting visibility. In the center of the room, a strange creature known as Child of Underground waits. 

Small but terrifying, it radiates a sinister aura. 

Its body is made of ancient roots covered in moss, and every movement produces a soft rustling sound. Only the reflection of light reveals the danger it poses.
