North Transition - Room 3:

-In this cold and dark room to the north, a figure looms amidst scattered stones and ancient bones. 
Grimfang, with its jagged teeth, stands threateningly. 
Its massive body is covered in darkened fur, and every step it takes shakes the ground. 
In the depths of the room, the echoes of an ancient power can be heard, but approaching the creature requires great courage.
